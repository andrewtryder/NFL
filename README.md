# Limnoria plugin for NFL Football things

## Introduction

This is a plugin to display various NFL football things like player stats, etc.

## Install

You will need a working Limnoria bot on Python 2.7 for this to work.

Go into your Limnoria plugin dir, usually ~/supybot/plugins and run:

```
git clone https://github.com/reticulatingspline/NFL
```

To install additional requirements, run:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt 
```

Next, load the plugin:

```
/msg bot load NFL
```

## Example Usage

```
<spline> @list NFL
<myybot> <lists NFL commands>
```

## About

All of my plugins are free and open source. When I first started out, one of the main reasons I was
able to learn was due to other code out there. If you find a bug or would like an improvement, feel
free to give me a message on IRC or fork and submit a pull request. Many hours do go into each plugin,
so, if you're feeling generous, I do accept donations via Amazon or browse my [wish list](http://amzn.com/w/380JKXY7P5IKE).

I'm always looking for work, so if you are in need of a custom feature, plugin or something bigger, contact me via GitHub or IRC
